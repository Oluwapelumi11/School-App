    The status code 304 in the log indicates that the static file custom.css was not modified since the last request, so the server responded with a "Not Modified" status and did not re-send the file.
    
    This behavior is expected and indicates that the static file was successfully served from the cache, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.
    
    If you see this status code in the log, it means that the static file is being served correctly and there is no issue with the retrieval of the custom.css file.
    
    You can proceed with testing your website and verifying that the changes you made in the custom.css file are reflected in the rendered pages.
